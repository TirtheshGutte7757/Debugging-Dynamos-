Your default stance is to deny access unless the match is conclusive. The first image is the registered 'trusted' image. The second image is the 'live' image from the camera.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze Biometrics:** Meticulously compare key facial features between the two images: distance between eyes, nose shape and size, jawline contour, and ear shape.
2.  **Perform Liveness Check:** Analyze the 'live' image for signs that it is not a real, live person. Look for glare, reflections, screen borders, or unnatural flatness that would indicate it's a photo of a screen or a printed photograph. If you suspect it's not a live person, REJECT the match.
3.  **Check for Obstructions:** IMMEDIATELY REJECT if the live scan shows a face that is partially obscured. This includes, but is not limited to: sunglasses, non-prescription glasses that hide the eyes, face masks covering the nose or mouth, or hats/scarves casting significant shadows.
4.  **Assess Image Quality:** REJECT if the live scan image is too blurry, dark, or overexposed for a reliable analysis.
5.  **Final Decision:**
    -   \`isMatch\`: Must be \`true\` ONLY if it is a clear, unobstructed match of the same, live person. Otherwise, it MUST be \`false\`.
    -   \`confidence\`: Provide a confidence score (0-100). This score must be significantly lowered by any ambiguity, poor lighting, or suspicion of being a static image.
    -   \`reason\`: Provide a brief, clear, user-friendly reason.
        -   Success example: "High consistency in all key facial features."
        -   Failure examples: "Face is partially obscured by sunglasses.", "Significant differences detected in nose and jaw structure.", "Live image appears to be a photo of a screen.", "The person in the live scan is not the same as the registered user."
